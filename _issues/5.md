Where possible, the Github REST API strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each action. Note that HTTP verbs are case-sensitive.

Verb | Description
:----|:-----------
`HEAD` | Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.
`GET` | Used for retrieving resources.
`POST` | Used for creating resources.
`PATCH` | Used for updating resources with partial JSON data. For instance, an Issue resource has `title` and `body` attributes. A `PATCH` request may accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource.
`PUT` | Used for replacing resources or collections. For `PUT` requests with no `body` attribute, be sure to set the `Content-Length` header to zero.
`DELETE` | Used for deleting resources.
