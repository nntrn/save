You can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to make authenticated API calls. This example workflow creates an issue using the GitHub REST API:

```yml
name: Create issue on commit
on: [ push ]
jobs:
  create_issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write 
    steps:
      - name: Create issue using REST API
        run: |
          curl --request POST \
          --url https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues \
          --header 'authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}' \
          --header 'content-type: application/json' \
          --data '{
            "title": "Automated issue for commit: ${{ github.sha }}",
            "body": "This issue was automatically created by the GitHub Action workflow **${{ github.workflow }}**. \n\n The commit hash was: _${{ github.sha }}_."
            }' \
          --fail
```
