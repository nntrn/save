When a repository is set to automatically request checks for pushes, you can choose to skip checks for an individual commit you push. When a repository is _not_ set to  automatically request checks for pushes, you can request checks for an individual commit you push.

To skip or request checks for your commit, add one of the following trailer lines to the end of your commit message:

- To _skip checks_ for a commit, type your commit message and a short, meaningful description of your changes. After your commit description, before the closing quotation, add two empty lines followed by `skip-checks: true`:
  ```shell
  $ git commit -m "Update README
  >
  >
  skip-checks: true"
  ```
- To _request_ checks for a commit, type your commit message and a short, meaningful description of your changes. After your commit description, before the closing quotation, add two empty lines followed by `request-checks: true`:
  ```shell
  $ git commit -m "Refactor usability tests
  >
  >
  request-checks: true"
  ```
