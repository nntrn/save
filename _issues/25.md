Facebook use lowers grades:

http://mashable.com/2011/04/27/facebook-effect-students/

   "Students who use Facebook and hit the books simultaneously found
    their multitasking led to 20% lower grades than those of their more
    focused peers.  Facebook-using students also made less money during
    school from part-time work, putting in around five hours per week
    as opposed to 16 hours per week for a typical, unplugged counterpart."

http://lifehacker.com/163928/multitasking-less-efficient-easier-for-young-people

   "Psychologists say this kind of multitasking is easier for young
    adults than children or older people because of development in a
    certain area of the brain, and is also a lot less efficient than
    focusing on one task at a time."

   "Checking a Twitter, Facebook or email account for updates may be
    more tempting than alcohol and cigarettes, according to researchers
    who tried to measure how well people regulate their daily desires.
    Researchers also found that while sleep and sex may be stronger
    urges than certain drug addictions, people are more likely to give
    in to their addiction to use social or other types of media."

"Is Google Making Us Stupid?"   [excerpts]

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/
    
   "Over the past few years I've had an uncomfortable sense that
    someone, or something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the
    neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory. My mind isn't going-so
    far as I can tell-but it's changing. I'm not thinking the way
    I used to think. I can feel it most strongly when I'm reading.
    Immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy. My
    mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the
    argument, and I'd spend hours strolling through long stretches of
    prose. That's rarely the case anymore. Now my concentration often
    starts to drift after two or three pages. I get fidgety, lose the
    thread, begin looking for something else to do. I feel as if I'm
    always dragging my wayward brain back to the text. The deep reading
    that used to come naturally has become a struggle.

    I think I know what's going on. For more than a decade now, I've
    been spending a lot of time online, searching and surfing and
    sometimes adding to the great databases of the Internet. [...]

    The faster we surf across the Web-the more links we click and pages
    we view-the more opportunities Google and other companies gain to
    collect information about us and to feed us advertisements. Most of
    the proprietors of the commercial Internet have a financial stake
    in collecting the crumbs of data we leave behind as we flit from
    link to link-the more crumbs, the better. The last thing these
    companies want is to encourage leisurely reading or slow, concentrated
    thought. It's in their economic interest to drive us to distraction.
    [...]

    I'm haunted by that scene in 2001. What makes it so poignant, and
    so weird, is the computer's emotional response to the disassembly
    of its mind: its despair as one circuit after another goes dark,
    its childlike pleading with the astronaut-"I can feel it. I can
    feel it. I'm afraid"-and its final reversion to what can only be
    called a state of innocence. HAL's outpouring of feeling contrasts
    with the emotionlessness that characterizes the human figures
    in the film, who go about their business with an almost robotic
    efficiency. Their thoughts and actions feel scripted, as if they're
    following the steps of an algorithm. In the world of 2001, people have
    become so machinelike that the most human character turns out to be
    a machine. That's the essence of Kubrick's dark prophecy: as we
    come to rely on computers to mediate our understanding of the world,
    it is our own intelligence that flattens into artificial intelligence."

"How Social Media Is Ruining Your Mind"  [excerpts]

http://singularityhub.com/2011/12/13/how-social-media-is-ruining-your-mind/

    Enterprising scientists are tracking the effects of social media on
    the human brain and human behavior. They’ve begun to notice some
    interesting trends in the way users become distracted, self-promoting,
    and even drugged by the experiences on Web 2.0   [...]

    That same multitasking can cause users to become distracted, with
    minds halfway in the digital realm even when trying to focus on
    other tasks. Wherever the balance is struck between risk and benefit
    for social media it seems apparent that the impact on the brain is
    profound, rapidly onsetting, and growing. It takes just hours of
    regular online activity before scientists can detect changes in the
    mind, and those changes are only going to increase as people spend
    more time on Twitter, Facebook, etc. Billions more people around the
    globe will gain regular internet access in upcoming decades so it’s
    likely that these newly perceived trends are going to become a nearly
    universal part about what it means to be human in the 21st Century

"The Autumn of the Multitaskers"

   "Neuroscience is confirming what we all suspect: Multitasking is dumbing
    us down and driving us crazy."

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/11/the-autumn-of-the-multitaskers/6342/

   "Multitasking messes with the brain in several ways. At the most
    basic level, the mental balancing acts that it requires-the constant
    switching and pivoting-energize regions of the brain that specialize
    in visual processing and physical coordination and simultaneously
    appear to shortchange some of the higher areas related to memory and
    learning. We concentrate on the act of concentration at the expense
    of whatever it is that we're supposed to be concentrating on.

    What does this mean in practice? Consider a recent experiment at
    UCLA, where researchers asked a group of 20-somethings to sort index
    cards in two trials, once in silence and once while simultaneously
    listening for specific tones in a series of randomly presented
    sounds. The subjects' brains coped with the additional task by
    shifting responsibility from the hippocampus-which stores and
    recalls information-to the striatum, which takes care of rote,
    repetitive activities. Thanks to this switch, the subjects managed
    to sort the cards just as well with the musical distraction-but they
    had a much harder time remembering what, exactly, they'd been
    sorting once the experiment was over.  Even worse [...]"

This essay is a real gem, with many examples related to student learning.

   "The next generation, presumably, is the hardest-hit. They're the
    ones way out there on the cutting edge of the multitasking
    revolution, texting and instant messaging each other while they
    download music to their iPod and update their Facebook page and
    complete a homework assignment and keep an eye on the episode of The
    Hills flickering on a nearby television. (A recent study from the
    Kaiser Family Foundation found that 53 percent of students in grades
    seven through 12 report consuming some other form of media while
    watching television; 58 percent multitask while reading; 62 percent
    while using the computer; and 63 percent while listening to music.
    "I get bored if it's not all going at once," said a 17-year-old
    quoted in the study.) They're the ones whose still-maturing brains
    are being shaped to process information rather than understand or
    even remember it.  [...]
    
    It begins by giving us more tasks to do, making each task harder to
    do, and dimming the mental powers required to do them. It finishes
    by making us forget exactly how on earth we did them (assuming we
    didn't give up, or "multi-quit"), which makes them harder to do
    again."

   "In a seventy-five-minute class that permits students to be "plugged
    in," a student with an open laptop takes electronic notes just as
    much as he social networks: 34 minutes with a margin of error of
    5 minutes. Looking at websites that are relevant to class is only
    slightly more common than looking at websites that are irrelevant to
    class: 36 as opposed to 32 minutes. A student with an open laptop
    spends, on average, 27 minutes sending and receiving email and 11
    minutes reading an electronic newspaper. That these numbers sum to
    more than the seventy-five class minutes hints at the prevalence of
    in-class, electronic multitasking."

   "I disagree about the efficiency argument that was just made. It
    may be more efficient but the ability to multitask can divide your
    attention to the point where you may get things done but you may not
    be doing them to the best of your ability. For example, last year
    I was planning an (extracurricular) event and I had at least one
    hundred emails to take care of. I did it during one of my favorite
    classes and I really didn’t get much out of it that day. It was
    efficient because I planned the event and attended class, but both
    my emails and my notes suffered."

   "Wolf expressed her grave concern that the development of knowledge
    in children who are heavy users of the Internet could produce mere
    "decoders of information who have neither the time nor the motivation
    to think beneath or beyond their googled universes", and cautioned
    that the web's "immediacy and volume of information should not be
    confused with true knowledge".

   long term storage - they don't remember what they do

  "Studies pretty clearly show that when our attention is divided,
   it becomes much more difficult to transfer information from our
   short-term memory, which is just the very temporary store, to our
   long-term memory, which is the seat of understanding."

   "Author Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains"
  - using web rewires brain; switching tasks makes us forget

   "The depth of our intelligence hinges on our ability to transfer
    information from working memory, the scratch pad of consciousness,
    to long-term memory, the mind's filing system. When facts and     
    experiences enter our long-term memory, we are able to weave them
    into the complex ideas that give richness to our thought. But the
    passage from working memory to long-term memory also forms a     
    bottleneck in our brain. Whereas long-term memory has an almost
    unlimited capacity, working memory can hold only a relatively small
    amount of information at a time. And that short-term storage is    
    fragile: A break in our attention can sweep its contents from our
    mind.    [...]                                                   
                  
    Psychologists refer to the information flowing into our working
    memory as our cognitive load. When the load exceeds our mind's 
    ability to process and store it, we're unable to retain the   
    information or to draw connections with other memories. We can't
    translate the new material into conceptual knowledge. Our ability to
    learn suffers, and our understanding remains weak. That's why the   
    extensive brain activity that Small discovered in Web searchers may
    be more a cause for concern than for celebration. It points to     
    cognitive overload.                                           
                       
    The Internet is an interruption system. It seizes our attention only
    to scramble it. There's the problem of hypertext and the many       
    different kinds of media coming at us simultaneously. There's also
    the fact that numerous studies—including one that tracked eye     
    movement, one that surveyed people, and even one that examined the
    habits displayed by users of two academic databases—show that we  
    start to read faster and less thoroughly as soon as we go online.
    Plus, the Internet has a hundred ways of distracting us from our 
    onscreen reading. Most email applications check automatically for
    new messages every five or 10 minutes, and people routinely click
    the Check for New Mail button even more frequently. Office workers
    often glance at their inbox 30 to 40 times an hour. Since each    
    glance breaks our concentration and burdens our working memory, the
    cognitive penalty can be severe.  [...]                            
                                           
    But it would be a serious mistake to look narrowly at such benefits
    and conclude that the Web is making us smarter. In a Science article
    published in early 2009, prominent developmental psychologist       
    Patricia Greenfield  reviewed more than 40 studies of the effects of
    various types of media on intelligence and learning ability. She    
    concluded that "every medium develops some cognitive skills at the
    expense of others." Our growing use of the Net and other          
    screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the "widespread and
    sophisticated development of visual-spatial skills." But those gains
    go hand in hand with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of    
    "deep processing" that underpins "mindful knowledge acquisition,
    inductive analysis, critical thinking, imagination, and reflection."
    [...]

    Last year, researchers at Stanford found signs that this shift may
    already be well under way. They gave a battery of cognitive tests to
    a group of heavy media multitaskers as well as a group of relatively
    light ones. They discovered that the heavy multitaskers were much
    more easily distracted, had significantly less control over their
    working memory, and were generally much less able to concentrate on
    a task. Intensive multitaskers are "suckers for irrelevancy," says
    Clifford Nass, one professor who did the research. "Everything
    distracts them." Merzenich offers an even bleaker assessment: As we
    multitask online, we are "training our brains to pay attention to
    the crap."

    "With many students, it's not like they can't remember
    the material" when they move to a more advanced class, said
    Henry L. Roediger III, a psychologist at Washington University in
    St. Louis. "It's like they've never seen it before."

    "When students see a list of problems, all of the same kind, they
    know the strategy to use before they even read the problem," said
    Dr. Rohrer. "That's like riding a bike with training wheels."
    With mixed practice, he added, "each problem is different from the
    last one, which means kids must learn how to choose the appropriate
    procedure - just like they had to do on the test."

   "Technology makes the tiniest windows of time entertaining, and
    potentially productive. But scientists point to an unanticipated side
    effect: when people keep their brains busy with digital input, they
    are forfeiting downtime that could allow them to better learn and
    remember information, or come up with new ideas."

    to a new study.  Tween girls who spend much of their waking hours
    switching frantically between YouTube, Facebook, television and text
    messaging are more likely to develop social problems, says a Stanford
    University study published in a scientific journal on Wednesday."
